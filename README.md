The stake of our research is the safety of the installation which consists in carrying out studies to eliminate the uncertainties of exceeding the threshold level by the flood level (overflow S). To do this we will use the flood model which is based on a simplification of 1D hydrodynamic equations under the assumptions of constant and uniform discharge and very large rectangular section.
